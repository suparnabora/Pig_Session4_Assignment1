Method overloading is an example of Static Polymorphism. 

Yes we can overload a method with the same return type. E.g. we can have two functions with the same name  add() with different no of parameters but which have the same return type. 

function add(int a, int b)
{
	return(a + b);
}


function add(int a, int b, int c)
{
	return(a + b + c);
}
